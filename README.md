# The-Renamer
You might be thinking what is this. 

Well if you downloaded it I'm pretty sure you have a large collection 
of anime or shows or both of them.

I'm also guessing when you download either of those, the video files 
were named improperly and you might like to rename it episode wise.

If that is the case, you have an OCD for organization but worry not,
this program will help you rename all those episodes in one go and
save those valuable seconds which you can use watching those shows
or animes.

Use Wisely,
